The second bridge to span the East River, the opening of the Williamsburg Bridge transformed Williamsburg, especially the Southside, into a densely developed working class neighborhood. Larger six-story tenement buildings began to appear across the neighborhood, largely populated by Eastern European Jewish residents who had moved “across the bridge” from the Lower East Side. Non-Jewish immigrants from the Baltic states, Russia and Ukraine also moved to the area to take advantage of the newer and better housing that was available because of the building boom of the 1900s to 1920s. By 1920, the Southside was one of the most densely populated neighborhoods in the country.\n\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Another group that started to move \u003C/p>\u003Cp>Immigration, culture.
