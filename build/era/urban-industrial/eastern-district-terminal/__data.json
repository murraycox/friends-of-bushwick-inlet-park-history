With the advent of the railroad the Hudson and East Rivers became barriers rather than the conduits they had been with the opening of the Erie Canal. National freight lines terminated on the Hudson shore of New Jersey and the only way across New York Harbor was to put freight cars onto barges and float them across the water. In the 1870s a rail freight terminal was established on the Northside waterfront to handle all these freight cars, expanding to become the Brooklyn Eastern District Terminal (BEDT) in 1906. A network of rails ran up and down Kent and Wythe avenues and many of the side streets, serving sugar refineries, breweries, barrel makers, and meat packers among many others. BEDT, operational until the 1980s, occupied the waterfront from North 6\u003Csup>th\u003C/sup> to North 11\u003Csup>th\u003C/sup> Street.\u003C/p>\u003Cfigure class=\"figure\">\n                \u003Cimg src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/rwfq7xkd04l4/4auu1dE4q4zEwYJwJBVLr2/700b81b2abf47ce90188f39feec792e4/03_18_BEDT_yard_btw_N_8th_N_9th_St_TrainWeb.jpg\" class=\"figure-img\" alt=\"View of the BEDT yard between North 8th and North 9th Streets, date?
