With the advent of the railroad the Hudson and East Rivers became barriers rather than the conduits they had been with the opening of the Erie Canal. National freight lines terminated on the Hudson shore of New Jersey and the only way across New York Harbor was to put freight cars onto barges and float them across the water. In the 1870s a rail freight terminal was established on the Northside waterfront to handle all these freight cars, expanding to become the Brooklyn Eastern District Terminal (BEDT) in 1906. A network of rails ran up and down Kent and Wythe avenues and many of the side streets, serving sugar refineries, breweries, barrel makers, and meat packers among many others. BEDT, operational until the 1980s, occupied the waterfront from North 6\u003Csup>th\u003C/sup> to North 11\u003Csup>th\u003C/sup> Street.\u003C/p>\u003Cfigure class=\"figure\">\n                \u003Cimg src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/rwfq7xkd04l4/4auu1dE4q4zEwYJwJBVLr2/700b81b2abf47ce90188f39feec792e4/03_18_BEDT_yard_btw_N_8th_N_9th_St_TrainWeb.jpg\" class=\"figure-img\" alt=\"View of the BEDT yard between North 8th and North 9th Streets, date?

It was the last piece of Bushwick Inlet Park to be acquired, following a long battle by community members to push New York City to live up to its promise to Greenpoint and Williamsburg. After over 10 years of holdouts by the owner and inaction by the city, and in the face of relentless advocacy by the community, the City finally acquired the property in late 2016. Today, the building is vacant and scheduled for demolition by the end of 2024. Prior to leaving office in 2022 Mayor Bill de Blasio allocated $75 million in capital funding to build out the CitiStorage parcels. But first the property requires remediation.\u003C/p>\u003Cfigure class=\"figure\">\n                \u003Cimg src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/rwfq7xkd04l4/1i5joCKeofFk0qeRPxYhgG/1ae1b96de6bc48c28580b919c2722ead/03_21_1929_Aerial_view_BEDT_looking_south.jpg\" class=\"figure-img\" alt=\"Aerial view the Eastern Terminal District looking south\">\n                \u003Cfigcaption class=\"figure-caption\">Aerial view BEDT looking south, 1929\u003C/figcaption>\n              \u003C/figure>\u003Cfigure class=\"figure\">\n                \u003Cimg src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/rwfq7xkd04l4/2MV3GezBjdD323WNPZZErq/bb80849833676edf9f386a8a46410fcb/aerial_view_BEDT_section.jpeg\" class=\"figure-img\" alt=\"aerial view BEDT section\">\n                \u003Cfigcaption class=\"figure-caption\">1924 aerial shot of BIP from ZOLA map https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/ql4cfko71bqin61m924sy/zola-nyc-bip-aerial-1924.jpg?rlkey=q7wf5eq5rigqnjwzhk7x1qcrn&dl=0\u003C/figcaption>\n              \u003C/figure>\u003Cp>\u003C/p>",{"id":10,"name":11,"link":12,"type":13,"eraID":6},"the-creek-disappears","The Creek Disappears","/era/urban-industrial/the-creek-disappears","chapter",{"id":15,"name":16,"link":17,"type":13,"eraID":6},"williamsburg-bridge","Williamsburg Bridge","/era/urban-industrial/williamsburg-bridge"],"uses":{"params":["era","chapter"]}}]}
