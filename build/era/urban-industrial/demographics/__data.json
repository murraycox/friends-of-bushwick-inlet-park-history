Upland, Greenpoint and Williamsburg were working-class neighborhoods of mostly wood-frame tenements and row houses. Masonry buildings were less common and largely restricted to the higher elevation (and higher income) parts of the neighborhood â€“ the original Williamsbugh village between Grand Street and Broadway in the Southside; North 8th Street and Berry in the Northside; and Java to Calyer Streets in Greenpoint. At this point, the demographics were already shifting from the predominant German and Irish immigrants of the mid-19th century to Italians, Poles and other Eastern Europeans who moved to the area in large numbers starting in the 1880s and 1890s.[WD1]\u003C/p>\u003Cfigure class=\"figure\">\n                  \u003Cimg src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/rwfq7xkd04l4/1B0E3mSfoQWtClfBRnyDbe/d5e4a6b6dddb7c3eb40d159a20e9729b/Broadway-20Kent-20ferry-201922-20merlis.png\" class=\"figure-img\" alt=\"Broadway-20Kent-20ferry-201922-20merlis\">\n                  \u003Cfigcaption class=\"figure-caption\">Peck slip ferry terminal at Broadway and Kent, 1922.
