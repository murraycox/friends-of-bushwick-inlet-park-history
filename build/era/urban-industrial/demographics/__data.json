Upland, Greenpoint and Williamsburg were working-class neighborhoods of mostly wood-frame tenements and row houses. Masonry buildings were less common and largely restricted to the higher elevation (and higher income) parts of the neighborhood – the original Williamsbugh village between Grand Street and Broadway on the Southside; North 8\u003Csup>th\u003C/sup> Street and Berry on the Northside; and Java to Calyer Streets in Greenpoint.
