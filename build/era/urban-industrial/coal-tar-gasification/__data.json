In the mid to late 19th century coal-tar gas provided illumination and fuel for cooking to the City’s residents. The coal-tar distillation process required tons of coal per day, which in turn meant that coal-tar plants had to be located where they could get easy access to coal. The north Williamsburg waterfront – long since expanded with landfill into the East River – was one such location. In the early 1850s, the Williamsburg Gas Light Company was established on the block between North 10th and North 11th Streets. Other manufactured gas plants (MGP) in the area included the block of Berry Street between North 12th and North 13th Street (to the west of the asphalt softball field at McCarren Park, now partly occupied by the William Vale Hotel). The Williamsburg Gas Light Company eventually became part of Brooklyn Union Gas – whose headquarters was in a grand cast-iron building at South 2nd and Bedford. \u003C/p>\u003Cfigure class=\"figure\">\n                  \u003Cimg src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/rwfq7xkd04l4/3RIggOul3fVfClsoXRNXZa/282255cda46715da32477d3c17f42292/03_07_Williamsburgh_Gas_Works.png\" class=\"figure-img\" alt=\"Williamsburgh Gas Works (Source).\">\n                  \u003Cfigcaption class=\"figure-caption\">Williamsburgh Gas Works (Source).\u003C/figcaption>\n                \u003C/figure>\u003Cp>The newly opened park parcel at 50 Kent once housed large gas holding tanks that were part of the Williamsburg Gas Company operation, resulting in contamination that extended more than 20 feet below the surface. Contamination from this site is also believed to have leached under adjacent parcels. 50 Kent was remediated by National Grid (the successor company to Williamsburg Gas and Brooklyn Union Gas) in 2017. In 2018, the Parks Department approved a design for this parcel, designed by Abel Bainnson Butz and construction was completed in 2022. The western parcel on this block was also part of the gas works and was used for storing and unloading coal and other operations – less contaminating, but by no means clean.\u003C/p>\u003Cfigure class=\"figure\">\n                  \u003Cimg src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/rwfq7xkd04l4/6P5hsGJK0GvIE3kWxpbUYj/c4c3e1db0b3a3e5d68f2336d867703ef/03_09_1922_Brooklyn_Union_Gas_headquarters_S2nd_St_Bedford_Ave_Merlis.png\" class=\"figure-img\" alt=\"Brooklyn Union Gas' headquarters at South 2nd Street and Bedford Avenue, 1922.
