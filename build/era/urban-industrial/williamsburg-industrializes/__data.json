Pratt soon sold his company to John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Company, in the process becoming one of the richest Americans of his age. Pratt’s legacy lives on in philanthropic endeavors such as Pratt Institute and the Astral Apartments in Greenpoint (built by Pratt as a philanthropic endeavor to improve the quality of housing for his workers), but it also lives on in the ground contamination of the Bayside site at Bushwick Inlet Park. The Pratt Bushwick Inlet site was operated by Standard Oil through the 1930s, and was then acquired by Texaco, which operated the site through the 1960s. In more recent years the site was operated as a home heating oil storage depot for Bayside Oil. This Bayside parcel of the Park, 8 acres in total, is currently undergoing testing for future remediation of fossil fuel contamination dating back almost 150 years.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Carousel? or side by side images: \u003C/p>\u003Cfigure class=\"figure\">\n                \u003Cimg src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/rwfq7xkd04l4/3F4kVXPcXH1KFe5aSuO9zn/a4b1b19a9b2290a84c8f05cd92dffa96/Loading_Vessels_With_Barrels.jpg\" class=\"figure-img\" alt=\"Loading Barrels\">\n                \u003Cfigcaption class=\"figure-caption\">Loading barrels at Pratt's Astral Oil Works.

Founded in New York City by brothers William and Frederick Havemeyer in 1802, the company relocated to the Williamsburgh waterfront in 1854 to create a larger factory with direct access to the waterfront. The larger facilities and vastly expanded capacity allowed the Havemeyers to transform sugar from a luxury to a commodity and led to the creation of multiple other factories up and down the Williamsburg waterfront, in DUMBO and even in Greenpoint. The original Havemeyer’s factory burned down in 1881 and in 1884 was replaced with the refinery that still stands at South 2\u003Csup>nd\u003C/sup> and Kent Avenue (the company was renamed Domino in the early 20\u003Csup>th\u003C/sup> century, taking its name from its iconic domino-shaped sugar cubes). The Domino site is now being redeveloped for large-scale housing and commercial office use. Its 5- acre park, designed by Field Operations, includes numerous fragments of industrial archaeology salvaged from within the refinery and raw sugar warehouse.\u003C/p>\u003Cfigure class=\"figure\">\n                \u003Cimg src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/rwfq7xkd04l4/75PTx8xF16CM5Xw7oH0paO/edbdee4f401d7b4ec8dea53978a74de9/domino_1905.jpg\" class=\"figure-img\" alt=\"Domino 1905\">\n                \u003Cfigcaption class=\"figure-caption\">Domino sugar refinery, 1905 view from the Williamsburg Bridge.\u003C/figcaption>\n              \u003C/figure>\u003Cfigure class=\"figure\">\n                \u003Cimg src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/rwfq7xkd04l4/3cu1G0JP1SaDhz7GwisIN6/a6d7a09dca53fd425588a85d37350542/American_Sugar_Brooklyn_HAER_NY-548-17.jpg\" class=\"figure-img\" alt=\"Domino filters\">\n                \u003Cfigcaption class=\"figure-caption\">View inside the filter house of the Domino Sugar Refinery, ca. 2012.

Soon after, foundries and ironworks began appearing upland throughout the area. The Continental Iron Works was one such operation, located on the East River just north of Bushwick Inlet. Founded in 1861 by engineer and shipbuilder Thomas F. Rowland, the Continental Ironworks became famous a few years later for the construction of the ironclad \u003Ci>USS Monitor\u003C/i>. The \u003Ci>Monitor\u003C/i> was launched from the foot of Quay Street, just north of Bushwick Inlet. Today, the Greenpoint Monitor Museum owns the property just to the south of where the \u003Ci>Monitor\u003C/i> was launched and plans to construct a museum on the site. This museum will sit at the northern terminus of Bushwick Inlet Park and will be part of the continuous waterfront open space connecting Newtown Creek to Domino Park.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Among the dozens of ironworks located around Bushwick Inlet, one of note was the Green Point Iron Works, located on the south side of Quay Street east of West Street, part of what is now 40 Quay Street. Other important ironworks in the area include Hecla Ironworks on North 11th Street (part which is now home to Brooklyn Brewery, and part of which is a designated NYC Landmark) and Tuttle &amp; Bailey on North 10th and North 11th Streets.\u003C/p>\u003Cfigure class=\"figure\">\n                \u003Cimg src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/rwfq7xkd04l4/3ksGfAV9R1XQmBf6T5jfsF/a712f9c6b35ea4cecc826e2035cad187/03_11_1910_Continental_Iron_Works_operations.png\" class=\"figure-img\" alt=\"Continental Iron Works operations, circa 1910 (Source?).\">\n                \u003Cfigcaption class=\"figure-caption\">Continental Iron Works operations, circa 1910 (Source?).\u003C/figcaption>\n              \u003C/figure>\u003Cfigure class=\"figure\">\n                \u003Cimg src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/rwfq7xkd04l4/63fjL9hiV5TZQGPL0GBsXn/74fc05982189d306ae34ebce11ac73ea/V1973.5.798a.jpg\" class=\"figure-img\" alt=\"AMC\">\n                \u003Cfigcaption class=\"figure-caption\">American Manufacturing Company complex, 1940s?, view looking west on Noble Street?.
