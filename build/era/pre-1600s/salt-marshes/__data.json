(https://www.ncwetlands.org/learn/aboutncswetlands/types/)","\u003Cp>Between each of these branches of Bushwick Creek were large areas of salt marshes and wetlands, covering all of todayâ€™s McCarren Park and the Greenpoint-Williamsburg Industrial Business Zone (IBZ) to the west of McCarren, and extending inland as far as Humboldt Street to the east and Hope Street to the south. A large \u003C/p>\u003Cp>island, running roughly from North 13\u003Csup>th\u003C/sup> Street to North 15\u003Csup>th\u003C/sup> Street, and from Wythe Avenue to the eastern end of the McCarren track, separated the different branches of the Creek. Depending on the tides, large parts of the Creek system were variously exposed or covered with salt water. Together with nearby Newtown Creek, the waterway was part of the rich and fertile wetlands that had supported the indigenous populations in the area for centuries.\u003C/p>\u003Cfigure class=\"figure\">\n                \u003Cimg src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/rwfq7xkd04l4/1thEd0WUTLikgPdt3Ct5K1/ee9347b25ec0c13ef2cee32d2907f7bf/201604BackThen.jpg\" class=\"figure-img\" alt=\"Stacks of salt hay\">\n                \u003Cfigcaption class=\"figure-caption\">Stacks of salt hay in the Scarborough (Maine) marshes.
