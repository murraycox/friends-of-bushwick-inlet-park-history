Around Grand Street the terrain transitioned from sandy beach to sandy bluffs that rose as high as 60’. In colonial times the prominent bluff jutting into the East River at about South 4th Street was called the Keikout, or “Lookout”. The lower-lying sandy area along the Williamsburg shore was called the Strand (het Strand), and a shore road extended roughly along today’s Wythe Avenue from about Broadway to North 10th Street, with farms fronting the road and overlooking the East River. A large willow grove was found along the lower-lying shore areas from about North 7th to North 11th Streets. Further north in Greenpoint, another point of land extended out into the East River at India Street – originally called Cherry Point by the first European settlers, it was later named Green Point after the lush foliage on the point.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>In addition to the large hill at Bedford and South 4th Street (also called the Keikout), there were two other prominent hills, one centered around North 8th Street and Berry, and the second around Manhattan Avenue and Meserole Avenue. In the 19th century, these three hills became were the first areas to urbanize. Prior to the 17th century, Indigenous pathways led around these hills to the shoreline and creeks – these would later become colonial roads, and are still readable in our landscape as Metropolitan Avenue, Flushing Avenue, Bushwick Avenue, and Woodpoint Road.\u003C/p>"],"uses":{"params":["era","chapter"]}}]}
