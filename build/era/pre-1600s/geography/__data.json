The high-water line south of the inlet was located just west of Kent Avenue, while north of the inlet the high-water line was east of West Street. The inlet itself extended from North 12th Street to Calyer Street at its widest expanse.[WD1]\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Now just a small cove on the East River, Bushwick Inlet was historically the mouth of Bushwick Creek, an extensive inland waterway that included mudflats, salt marshes and tidal creeks covering almost half of the Northside and large parts of southern Greenpoint, including all of what is now McCarren Park. The south branch of Bushwick Creek meandered along Union Avenue and was navigable by rowboat as far south as Metropolitan Avenue. Two central branches of the Creek extended due east to about Leonard and Frost Streets and Frost Street and Manhattan Avenue on today’s map. The north branches of the Creek reached as far inland as the intersections of Nassau Avenue and Lorimer Street and Driggs Avenue and Leonard Street.\u003C/p>",{"id":6,"name":7,"slug":6},"pre-1600s","Pre Colonial Era"],"uses":{"params":["era","chapter"]}}]}
