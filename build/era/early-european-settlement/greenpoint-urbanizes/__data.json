The Northside was slower to urbanize, in part because of the extensive meadows around Swede’s Fly. As in the 18th century, this area retained farms and orchards through the 1830s and into the 1840s. Further north, Greenpoint too was farms and orchards. Industrialist Neziah Bliss, who had married into the Meserole family, saw Greenpoint as a convenient place for shipbuilding and housing for the men who built ships. Bliss, with his partner Eliphalet Nott (president of Union College upstate), laid out the Greenpoint street grid – then A through Q streets – in 1834 and developed the earliest urban lots.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>While both Williamsburgh and Greenpoint were developing as urban centers, development in the area immediately around Bushwick Creek was much slower. The area between Greenpoint and Williamsburgh – north of North 9\u003Csup>th\u003C/sup> Street and through McCarren Park – was still low-lying wetlands and salt marshes, largely unsuited for habitation. These wetlands were a barrier between the two villages - Bushwick Creek and Newtown Creek rendered Greenpoint mostly inaccessible by land. Residents wanting to travel from the Northside to Greenpoint by land had to go east on Metropolitan to Bushwick Avenue, and then north on Woodpoint Road into Greenpoint. The first direct connection between Greenpoint and the Northside was via a footbridge constructed by Bliss in 1838 over Bushwick Creek along present-day Kent Avenue and Franklin Street as part of a turnpike connecting Williamsburgh, Greenpoint and Astoria.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>This was just one of many much more radical changes that were being wrought upon the landscape of Williamsburg and Greenpoint, changes that centered around Bushwick Inlet.\u003C/p>",{"id":10,"name":11,"link":12,"type":13,"eraID":6},"the-founding-of-williamsburgh","The Founding of Williamsburgh","/era/early-european-settlement/the-founding-of-williamsburgh","chapter",{"id":15,"name":16,"link":17,"type":13,"eraID":6},"early-industrialization","Early Industrialization","/era/early-european-settlement/early-industrialization"],"uses":{"params":["era","chapter"]}}]}
