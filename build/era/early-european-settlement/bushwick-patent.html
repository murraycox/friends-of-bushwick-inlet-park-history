                </figure><p>In 1609, Henry Hudson, exploring for the Dutch East India Company, sailed up the Hudson River as far north as the town of Kingston, and by virtue of this endeavor, laid the basis for Dutch colonial claims to the Hudson valley and lower Hudson estuary. In 1621, the Dutch <i>West</i> India Company was established to administer the colony of New Netherland, which extended in name from the Chesapeake Bay to Cape Cod. By 1624, the Dutch had established the settlement of New Amsterdam at the foot of Manhattan Island. Europeans first started arriving in northern Brooklyn in the 1620s and 1630s. Most of the first arrivals were squatters, living on the land without title or permission from either the Dutch West India Company or the Lenape. While New Netherland was a Dutch colony, the early residents of the Williamsburg-Greenpoint area were a polyglot of Europeans – Scandinavian, French, English and African, as well as Dutch.</p><p>Among the earliest settlers in the area was Joris Rapelye, one of a group of Protestant Walloons (French-speaking emigrants from the Wallonia area of today’s Belgium), who settled in the Wallabout in 1837, near what is today the former Naval Hospital at Flushing Avenue and Williamsburg Street.</p><p>In August of 1838 West India Company Director Willem Kieft purchased what would soon become the town of Bushwick from the ‘chiefs of Keskaechquerem’. This purchase comprised a triangular tract extending from the East River on the west, Newtown Creek to the north and Division Street/Broadway to the south, tapering to a dull point at about the place where Bushwick Avenue, Jamaica Avenue and the Jackie Robinson Parkway intersect (near Cypress Hills Cemetery).</p><figure class="figure">

                </figure><h1><b>Early Settlers</b></h1><p>Many of the early settlers concentrated along the East River shore. Whether by coincidence or coordination, the waterfront areas immediately to the north and south of Bushwick Inlet were owned by Scandinavian immigrants. Jan de Swede (non-Dutch residents were often named for their country of origin) owned a large tract of land upland from the East River, running along the west bank of Bushwick Creek’s south branch. Claes Carstensen (Claes the Norman) owned and farmed the property from the Inlet to about North 7th Street, west of Jan de Swede’s property. On the Greenpoint side, Dirck Volckertsen (Dirck the Norman/Norseman) was granted land in 1645, and by 1655 had constructed a house that “rested upon a knoll, about where Calyer street is laid out, and from one to two hundred feet west of the present line of Franklin street”. Volckertsen’s lawn “sloped gently in front to Norman’s kill [Bushwick Creek] on the south, and gradually to the East River on the west. The house was of stone, one and a half stories in height, with dormer windows, built in a quaint Dutch style. [Felter, 18]</p><p>Volckertsen’s holdings encompassed most of what is today considered Greenpoint. In 1653 he sold a large section of this property to Jacob Hay and his wife Christina Cappoens. This land passed to their daughter, Maria Hay and through Cappoens’ will, remained in the family for three generations. Maria’s third husband Peter Praa (a Frenchman) separately purchased the balance of Volkertsen’s holdings, thus putting all of Greenpoint in the Praa family’s hands.</p><!-- HTML_TAG_END --> <div
