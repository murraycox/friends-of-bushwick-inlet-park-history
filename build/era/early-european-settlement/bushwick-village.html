For Stuyvesant, Bushwick was a strategic and defensible outpost on Long Island and a buffer for his own bowery (farm) just across the East River. Residents were mandated to erect houses within the palisades at Bushwick Village. The Bushwick settlers also established a stockaded outpost at the Keikout (Lookout) near Bedford Avenue and South 4th Street.</p><figure class="figure">

                </figure><h1><b>Early farms</b></h1><p>The wetlands of Bushwick and Newtown Creeks dictated much of the early agriculture and geography in north Brooklyn. Early on, two tide mills were constructed on Newtown Creek, one at about the intersection of Grand Street and Metropolitan Avenue, the second about mile to the west. However, there is no evidence of tide mills on Bushwick Creek, perhaps because the creek was much smaller and thus saw less tidal action. Indigenous pathways became colonial farm roads – Woodpoint Road led from the village center to a public landing on the north branch of Bushwick Creek near the intersection of Driggs Avenue and Lorimer Street (the McCarren Park comfort station).</p><p>Dutch rule of New Amsterdam ended in 1665, but for most of the 17th and 18th century, “Dutch” traditions continued to dominate in north Brooklyn, even while the settlers continued to be a polyglot. Most impactful among these was Jan Meserole, a French Huguenot who arrived in New Amsterdam in 1663. By the early 1680s, he had acquired the Keikout farm near South 4th Street and Kent Avenue. His son John married Elizabeth Praa, one of the four daughters of Maria Hay and Peter Praa. Though the names Hay, Cappoens and Praa are probably unfamiliar to many Greenpoint residents, many of the names of their descendants through the marriages of their four daughters will not be: Provost, Meserole, Conselyea, Van Cott, De Voe, Debevoise and Calyer.</p><p>For almost 200 years, Williamsburg and Greenpoint existed as farming communities, heavily reliant on slave labor. As late as 1790, only 540 people occupied the entire Town of Bushwick (today’s Bushwick, Greenpoint and Williamsburg), and a third of them were enslaved Blacks. Slavery in New York State was gradually phased out starting in 1802, with full manumission granted for all enslaved people in 1827. Perhaps not coincidentally, this period also marks the transition of Williamsburg and Greenpoint from isolated rural and agrarian places to urban and industrial centers.</p><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div>

For Stuyvesant, Bushwick was a strategic and defensible outpost on Long Island and a buffer for his own bowery (farm) just across the East River. Residents were mandated to erect houses within the palisades at Bushwick Village. The Bushwick settlers also established a stockaded outpost at the Keikout (Lookout) near Bedford Avenue and South 4th Street.\u003C/p>\u003Cfigure class=\"figure\">\n                  \u003Cimg src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/rwfq7xkd04l4/3EeNnwEnYtti3ydeNDTGxU/44212b4f89c31a8e9b7ec077352ec976/Armbruster-20composite.png\" class=\"figure-img\" alt=\"Armbruster-20composite\">\n                  \u003Cfigcaption class=\"figure-caption\">Bushwick in the mid-18th century.\u003C/figcaption>\n                \u003C/figure>\u003Cfigure class=\"figure\">\n                  \u003Cimg src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/rwfq7xkd04l4/KqTsH3jFBpVuC17mIcEYt/7f072f8acd95f2efc9bf68c42135034b/Miller-20Keikout-20Screen-20Shot-202018-01-26-20at-209.33.43-20PM.png\" class=\"figure-img\" alt=\"Miller homestead drwaing\">\n                  \u003Cfigcaption class=\"figure-caption\">Miller (formerly Meserole) homestead on the Keickout bluff, South 4th Street and Kent Avenue, mid-1700s\u003C/figcaption>\n                \u003C/figure>\u003Cfigure class=\"figure\">\n                  \u003Cimg src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/rwfq7xkd04l4/5ESRBJufle5CwoeInoAx7b/b46feb5481416cc54b1ffcf8f9ba2428/Boerum-20mansion-20Kent-20avenue-20Broadway-20v19740221148.jpg\" class=\"figure-img\" alt=\"Boerum farmhouse at Clymer Street and Kent Avenue, mid-1700s.\">\n                  \u003Cfigcaption class=\"figure-caption\">Boerum farmhouse at Clymer Street and Kent Avenue, mid-1700s.\u003C/figcaption>\n                \u003C/figure>\u003Cfigure class=\"figure\">\n                  \u003Cimg src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/rwfq7xkd04l4/4FyOmZ7rGjekN6vktQ32v8/5960cb9eb8d34daca2eb2035bd4613a4/Remsen-20farmhouse-20Kent-20avenue-20Clymer-20v19740221149.jpg\" class=\"figure-img\" alt=\"Remsen farm house\">\n                  \u003Cfigcaption class=\"figure-caption\">Remsen farm house\u003C/figcaption>\n                \u003C/figure>\u003Ch1>\u003Cb>Early farms\u003C/b>\u003C/h1>\u003Cp>The wetlands of Bushwick and Newtown Creeks dictated much of the early agriculture and geography in north Brooklyn. Early on, two tide mills were constructed on Newtown Creek, one at about the intersection of Grand Street and Metropolitan Avenue, the second about mile to the west. However, there is no evidence of tide mills on Bushwick Creek, perhaps because the creek was much smaller and thus saw less tidal action. Indigenous pathways became colonial farm roads – Woodpoint Road led from the village center to a public landing on the north branch of Bushwick Creek near the intersection of Driggs Avenue and Lorimer Street (the McCarren Park comfort station).\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Dutch rule of New Amsterdam ended in 1665, but for most of the 17th and 18th century, “Dutch” traditions continued to dominate in north Brooklyn, even while the settlers continued to be a polyglot. Most impactful among these was Jan Meserole, a French Huguenot who arrived in New Amsterdam in 1663. By the early 1680s, he had acquired the Keikout farm near South 4th Street and Kent Avenue. His son John married Elizabeth Praa, one of the four daughters of Maria Hay and Peter Praa. Though the names Hay, Cappoens and Praa are probably unfamiliar to many Greenpoint residents, many of the names of their descendants through the marriages of their four daughters will not be: Provost, Meserole, Conselyea, Van Cott, De Voe, Debevoise and Calyer.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>For almost 200 years, Williamsburg and Greenpoint existed as farming communities, heavily reliant on slave labor. As late as 1790, only 540 people occupied the entire Town of Bushwick (today’s Bushwick, Greenpoint and Williamsburg), and a third of them were enslaved Blacks. Slavery in New York State was gradually phased out starting in 1802, with full manumission granted for all enslaved people in 1827. Perhaps not coincidentally, this period also marks the transition of Williamsburg and Greenpoint from isolated rural and agrarian places to urban and industrial centers.\u003C/p>"}},"uses":{"params":["era","chapter"]}}];
