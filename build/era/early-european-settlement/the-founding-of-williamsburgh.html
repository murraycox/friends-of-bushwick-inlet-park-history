Two competing villages – Williamsburgh and Yorkton – were laid out with streets in 1800 to 1802 respectively, the former to the north of Grand Street, the latter to the south. Of the two, Yorkton was marginally more successful, but Williamsburgh won the naming rights (the Williams of Williamsburgh being the name of the surveyor hired by Richard Woodhull, who bought a 13-acre farm that ran from Metropolitan Avenue to Bushwick Creek in 1800).</p><p>The original vision for Williamsburgh was a suburb of New York City, along the lines of Hezekiah Pierrepont’s Brooklyn Heights. From the 1820s into the 1840s, the Northside waterfront - where Marsha P. Johnson and Bushwick Inlet Parks now stand - was a resort and play area. A “pleasure railway” sat on the waterfront between North 6<sup>th</sup> and North 7<sup>th</sup> Streets, while a portion of the CitiStorage North site was known as Willow Grove, a popular gathering place for East River bathers. At the corner of North 11th Street and Kent Avenue stood the Willow Grove Tavern, also known as Willow Grove Cottage.</p><p>Despite these grand plans, Williamsburgh was slow to develop. It was not until 1827 that the Village of Williamsburgh was incorporated. The original village occupied what is now the Northside and Southside, as far east as Union Avenue. At that time, it had a population of about 1,000; the rest of Bushwick (including Greenpoint) had just under 600 residents. In 1835, the Village was expanded to the east through the annexation of East Williamsburg to Bushwick Avenue. But the Village of Williamsburgh grew quickly, becoming a town of 5,000 people in 1840 and a city of over 40,000 by 1852. When Williamsburgh was absorbed into the City of Brooklyn in 1855, it had a population of 48,000 (Greenpoint at that time had a population of 5,500; the rest of Bushwick just 2,600).</p><figure class="figure">

A major impetus for the development of Williamsburgh and Greenpoint as industrial centers was the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825. The canal opened up the center of the country to the eastern markets, shifting agricultural production away from places like Bushwick and Flatbush, and creating the need for more shipping along with transshipping from barges to larger vessels. The Brooklyn waterfront, from Newtown Creek to Gowanus Creek, was quickly given over to factories and storehouses.</p><p></p><figure class="figure">

              </figure><h3><b>Greenpoint urbanizes</b></h3><p>Urban development in Williamsburgh was initially focused on the Southside and soon after in the annexed quarter East Williamsburgh east of Union Avenue. The Northside was slower to urbanize, in part because of the extensive meadows around Swede’s Fly. As in the 18th century, this area retained farms and orchards through the 1830s and into the 1840s. Further north, Greenpoint too was farms and orchards. Industrialist Neziah Bliss, who had married into the Meserole family, saw Greenpoint as a convenient place for shipbuilding and housing for the men who built ships. Bliss, with his partner Eliphalet Nott (president of Union College upstate), laid out the Greenpoint street grid – then A through Q streets – in 1834 and developed the earliest urban lots.</p><h3><b>Changing the Creek</b></h3><p>While both Williamsburgh and Greenpoint were developing as urban centers, development in the area immediately around Bushwick Creek was much slower. The area between Greenpoint and Williamsburgh – north of North 9<sup>th</sup> Street and through McCarren Park – was still low-lying wetlands and salt marshes, largely unsuited for habitation. These wetlands were a barrier between the two villages - Bushwick Creek and Newtown Creek rendered Greenpoint mostly inaccessible by land. Residents wanting to travel from the Northside to Greenpoint by land had to go east on Metropolitan to Bushwick Avenue, and then north on Woodpoint Road into Greenpoint. The first direct connection between Greenpoint and the Northside was via a footbridge constructed by Bliss in 1838 over Bushwick Creek along present-day Kent Avenue and Franklin Street as part of a turnpike connecting Williamsburgh, Greenpoint and Astoria.</p><p>This was just one of many much more radical changes that were being wrought upon the landscape of Williamsburg and Greenpoint, changes that centered around Bushwick Inlet. </p><!----></div> <div id="story-footer-navigation" class="svelte-xag86u"><div id="story-footer-navigation-back"><a

The canal opened up the center of the country to the eastern markets, shifting agricultural production away from places like Bushwick and Flatbush, and creating the need for more shipping along with transshipping from barges to larger vessels. The Brooklyn waterfront, from Newtown Creek to Gowanus Creek, was quickly given over to factories and storehouses.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003C/p>\u003Cfigure class=\"figure\">\n                \u003Cimg src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/rwfq7xkd04l4/6JTFmQzvBs5LPIl4iH9eCz/f5f02148fb8cff6080dfe567b2034a5f/1839-20Greenpoint-20John-20A-20Meserole-20farm-20bhs_bp003511846_a-scaled.jpg\" class=\"figure-img\" alt=\"1839-20Greenpoint-20John-20A-20Meserole-20farm-20bhs bp003511846 a-scaled\">\n                \u003Cfigcaption class=\"figure-caption\">1839 prospectus dividing the John A.

The Northside was slower to urbanize, in part because of the extensive meadows around Swede’s Fly. As in the 18th century, this area retained farms and orchards through the 1830s and into the 1840s. Further north, Greenpoint too was farms and orchards. Industrialist Neziah Bliss, who had married into the Meserole family, saw Greenpoint as a convenient place for shipbuilding and housing for the men who built ships. Bliss, with his partner Eliphalet Nott (president of Union College upstate), laid out the Greenpoint street grid – then A through Q streets – in 1834 and developed the earliest urban lots.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3>\u003Cb>Changing the Creek\u003C/b>\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>While both Williamsburgh and Greenpoint were developing as urban centers, development in the area immediately around Bushwick Creek was much slower. The area between Greenpoint and Williamsburgh – north of North 9\u003Csup>th\u003C/sup> Street and through McCarren Park – was still low-lying wetlands and salt marshes, largely unsuited for habitation. These wetlands were a barrier between the two villages - Bushwick Creek and Newtown Creek rendered Greenpoint mostly inaccessible by land. Residents wanting to travel from the Northside to Greenpoint by land had to go east on Metropolitan to Bushwick Avenue, and then north on Woodpoint Road into Greenpoint. The first direct connection between Greenpoint and the Northside was via a footbridge constructed by Bliss in 1838 over Bushwick Creek along present-day Kent Avenue and Franklin Street as part of a turnpike connecting Williamsburgh, Greenpoint and Astoria.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>This was just one of many much more radical changes that were being wrought upon the landscape of Williamsburg and Greenpoint, changes that centered around Bushwick Inlet. \u003C/p>"},lastChapter:{id:"bushwick-patent",name:"Bushwick Patent",link:"/era/early-european-settlement/bushwick-patent",type:"chapter",eraID:"early-european-settlement"},nextChapter:{id:"early-industrialization",name:"Early Industrialization",link:"/era/early-european-settlement/early-industrialization",type:"chapter",eraID:"early-european-settlement"}},uses:{params:["era","chapter"]}}],
