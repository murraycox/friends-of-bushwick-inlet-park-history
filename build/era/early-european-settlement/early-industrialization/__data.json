In 1848 the Sneden &amp; Williams shipyard was established on the north side of Bushwick Inlet, at the junction of the East River. As part of its construction, a bulkhead was constructed on the north side of the inlet and along the East River and the inlet along Quay Street was partially filled in from West Street to about the current shoreline. The Sneden &amp; Williams site later became the Continental Iron Works and was where the ironclad warship \u003Ci>U.S.S.

In the mid to late 19\u003Csup>th\u003C/sup> century coal-tar gas provided illumination and fuel for cooking to the City’s residents. The coal-tar distillation process required tons of coal per day, which in turn meant that manufactured gas plants had to be located where they could get easy access to coal. The Northside waterfront – expanded with landfill into the East River – was one such location. In the early 1850s, the Williamsburg Gas Light Company was established on the block between North 10\u003Csup>th\u003C/sup> and North 11\u003Csup>th\u003C/sup> Streets. Other manufactured gas plants in the area included the block of Berry Street between North 12\u003Csup>th\u003C/sup> and North 13\u003Csup>th\u003C/sup> Street (to the west of the asphalt softball field at McCarren Park, now partly occupied by the William Vale Hotel). The Williamsburg Gas Light Company eventually became part of Brooklyn Union Gas – whose headquarters once stood in a grand cast-iron building at South 2\u003Csup>nd\u003C/sup> and Bedford.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The newly opened Bushwick Inlet Park parcel at 50 Kent once housed large gas holding tanks that were part of the Williamsburg Gas Light Company operation, resulting in contamination that extended more than 20 feet below the surface. Contamination from this site has also leached under adjacent parcels. 50 Kent was remediated by National Grid (the successor firm to Williamsburg Gas and Brooklyn Union Gas) in 2017. In 2018, the Parks Department approved a design for this parcel, designed by Stantec and construction was completed in 2022. The western parcel on this block was also part of the gas works and was used for storing and unloading coal and other operations – less contaminating, but by no means clean.\u003C/p>"],"uses":{"params":["era","chapter"]}}]}
