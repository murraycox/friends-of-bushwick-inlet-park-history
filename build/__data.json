The master plan remains the guiding star for the development of Bushwick Inlet Park to this day.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The 2005 rezoning and the Bushwick Inlet Park master plan originally included a 1-acre site at the north side of Bushwick Inlet (to the west of the Motiva site) that is owned by the Greenpoint Monitor Museum. The property was donated to the Museum in 2003 by Motiva Enterprises, a joint venture of Shell Oil and Saudi Aramco, which had acquired the property from Texaco. In early plans for Bushwick Inlet Park, the Monitor Museum site is included as part of the park and the property is still mapped as parkland, however the City has since acknowledged that it has no intention of acquiring the Museum parcel through eminent domain.\u003C/p>",{"pre-1600s":1037,"early-european-settlement":1052,"urban-industrial":1080,"deindustrialization":1101,"the-future":1111},{"id":397,"name":398,"shortLabel":1038,"longLabel":1039,"link":1040,"view":397,"chapters":1041},"Pre 1620","Before 1620",null,{"the-creek":1042,"salt-marshes":1044,"the-waterfront":1046,"indigenous-population":1049},{"id":500,"name":511,"link":1043},"/era/pre-1600s/the-creek",{"id":128,"name":283,"link":1045},"/era/pre-1600s/salt-marshes",{"id":441,"name":1047,"link":1048},"The Waterfront","/era/pre-1600s/the-waterfront",{"id":171,"name":1050,"link":1051},"Indigenous Population","/era/pre-1600s/indigenous-population",{"id":672,"name":673,"shortLabel":1053,"longLabel":673,"link":1040,"view":672,"chapters":1054},"1620-1855",{"bushwick-patent":1055,"bushwick-village":1058,"the-founding-of-williamsburgh":1062,"greenpoint-urbanizes":1066,"early-industrialization":1070,"williamsburg-becomes-a-city":1073,"ecological-impact":1077},{"id":774,"name":1056,"link":1057},"Bushwick Patent","/era/early-european-settlement/bushwick-patent",{"id":1059,"name":1060,"link":1061},"bushwick-village","Bushwick Village","/era/early-european-settlement/bushwick-village",{"id":1063,"name":1064,"link":1065},"the-founding-of-williamsburgh","The Founding of Williamsburgh","/era/early-european-settlement/the-founding-of-williamsburgh",{"id":1067,"name":1068,"link":1069},"greenpoint-urbanizes","Greenpoint Urbanizes","/era/early-european-settlement/greenpoint-urbanizes",{"id":771,"name":1071,"link":1072},"Early Industrialization","/era/early-european-settlement/early-industrialization",{"id":1074,"name":1075,"link":1076},"williamsburg-becomes-a-city","Williamsburgh Becomes a City","/era/early-european-settlement/williamsburg-becomes-a-city",{"id":874,"name":1078,"link":1079},"Ecological Impact","/era/early-european-settlement/ecological-impact",{"id":884,"name":885,"shortLabel":1081,"longLabel":1082,"link":1040,"view":884,"chapters":1083},"1850-1950","Urban and Industrial Era",{"williamsburg-industrialize":1084,"demographics":1088,"the-creek-disappears":1092,"eastern-district-terminal":1095,"williamsburg-bridge":1098},{"id":1085,"name":1086,"link":1087},"williamsburg-industrialize","Williamsburg Industrialize","/era/urban-industrial/williamsburg-industrializes",{"id":1089,"name":1090,"link":1091},"demographics","Demographics","/era/urban-industrial/demographics",{"id":1093,"name":1001,"link":1094},"the-creek-disappears","/era/urban-industrial/the-creek-disappears",{"id":1096,"name":1003,"link":1097},"eastern-district-terminal","/era/urban-industrial/eastern-district-terminal",{"id":1099,"name":273,"link":1100},"williamsburg-bridge","/era/urban-industrial/williamsburg-bridge",{"id":1029,"name":1030,"link":1040,"view":1029,"chapters":1102},{"williamsburg-deindustrializes":1103,"community-plans-and-other-plans":1107},{"id":1104,"name":1105,"link":1106},"williamsburg-deindustrializes","Williamsburg Deindustrializes","/era/deindustrialization/williamsburg-deindustrializes",{"id":1108,"name":1109,"link":1110},"community-plans-and-other-plans","Community Plans and Other Plans","/era/deindustrialization/community-plans-and-other-plans",{"id":1033,"name":1034,"link":1040,"view":1033,"chapters":1112},{}],"uses":{}}]}
