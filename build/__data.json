And south of there was the Continental Iron Works. South of the inlet in Williamsburg, Standard Oil and the Williamsburg Gas Light Company continued to operate as described above. Cooperages (barrel factories – barrels were the preferred containers for bulk sugar and other products), distilleries, coal pockets (coal transfer stations) and sugar refineries occupied the waterfront south of North 4\u003Csup>th\u003C/sup> Street. The American Sugar Refining Company (previously Havemeyers &amp; Elder, later Domino Sugar) occupied the blocks from Grand Street to South 6\u003Csup>th\u003C/sup> Street (with the Williamsburg Bridge being under construction at this time); Mollenhauer’s sugar refinery was located between South 7\u003Csup>th\u003C/sup> Street and Division Avenue. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>First envisioned as a suburb for growing Manhattan across the river, Williamsburgh quickly became a center for manufacture.

Developed by landscape architect Donna Walcalvage and Stantec Engineering, the BIP master plan identifies use areas of the park – such as active and passive recreation areas – and guides the design development of each parcel as it comes online. The master plan was developed as part of a broad community engagement process and reflects the uses and features prioritized during that process. The master plan remains the guiding star for the development of Bushwick Inlet Park to this day.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The 2005 rezoning and the Bushwick Inlet Park master plan originally included a 1-acre site at the north side of Bushwick Inlet (to the west of the Motiva site) that is owned by the Greenpoint Monitor Museum. The property was donated to the Museum in 2003 by Motiva Enterprises, a joint venture of Shell Oil and Saudi Aramco, which had acquired the property from Texaco. In early plans for Bushwick Inlet Park, the Monitor Museum site is included as part of the park and the property is still mapped as parkland, however the City has since acknowledged that it has no intention of acquiring the Museum parcel through eminent domain.\u003C/p>",{"pre-1600s":199,"early-european-settlement":220,"urban-industrial":251,"deindustrialization":275,"the-future":285},{"id":144,"name":145,"shortLabel":200,"longLabel":201,"link":202,"view":144,"chapters":203},"Pre 1620","Before 1620",null,{"the-creek":204,"salt-marshes":208,"the-waterfront":212,"indigenous-population":216},{"id":205,"name":206,"link":207},"the-creek","The Creek","/era/pre-1600s/the-creek",{"id":209,"name":210,"link":211},"salt-marshes","Salt Marshes","/era/pre-1600s/salt-marshes",{"id":213,"name":214,"link":215},"the-waterfront","The Waterfront","/era/pre-1600s/the-waterfront",{"id":217,"name":218,"link":219},"indigenous-population","Indigenous Population","/era/pre-1600s/indigenous-population",{"id":161,"name":162,"shortLabel":221,"longLabel":162,"link":202,"view":161,"chapters":222},"1620-1855",{"bushwick-patent":223,"bushwick-village":227,"the-founding-of-williamsburgh":231,"greenpoint-urbanizes":235,"early-industrialization":239,"williamsburg-becomes-a-city":243,"ecological-impact":247},{"id":224,"name":225,"link":226},"bushwick-patent","Bushwick Patent","/era/early-european-settlement/bushwick-patent",{"id":228,"name":229,"link":230},"bushwick-village","Bushwick Village","/era/early-european-settlement/bushwick-village",{"id":232,"name":233,"link":234},"the-founding-of-williamsburgh","The Founding of Williamsburgh","/era/early-european-settlement/the-founding-of-williamsburgh",{"id":236,"name":237,"link":238},"greenpoint-urbanizes","Greenpoint Urbanizes","/era/early-european-settlement/greenpoint-urbanizes",{"id":240,"name":241,"link":242},"early-industrialization","Early Industrialization","/era/early-european-settlement/early-industrialization",{"id":244,"name":245,"link":246},"williamsburg-becomes-a-city","Williamsburgh Becomes a City","/era/early-european-settlement/williamsburg-becomes-a-city",{"id":248,"name":249,"link":250},"ecological-impact","Ecological Impact","/era/early-european-settlement/ecological-impact",{"id":172,"name":173,"shortLabel":252,"longLabel":253,"link":202,"view":172,"chapters":254},"1850-1950","Urban and Industrial Era",{"williamsburg-industrialize":255,"demographics":259,"the-creek-disappears":263,"eastern-district-terminal":267,"williamsburg-bridge":271},{"id":256,"name":257,"link":258},"williamsburg-industrialize","Williamsburg Industrialize","/era/urban-industrial/williamsburg-industrializes",{"id":260,"name":261,"link":262},"demographics","Demographics","/era/urban-industrial/demographics",{"id":264,"name":265,"link":266},"the-creek-disappears","The Creek Disappears","/era/urban-industrial/the-creek-disappears",{"id":268,"name":269,"link":270},"eastern-district-terminal","Eastern District Terminal","/era/urban-industrial/eastern-district-terminal",{"id":272,"name":273,"link":274},"williamsburg-bridge","Williamsburg Bridge","/era/urban-industrial/williamsburg-bridge",{"id":191,"name":192,"link":202,"view":191,"chapters":276},{"williamsburg-deindustrializes":277,"community-plans-and-other-plans":281},{"id":278,"name":279,"link":280},"williamsburg-deindustrializes","Williamsburg Deindustrializes","/era/deindustrialization/williamsburg-deindustrializes",{"id":282,"name":283,"link":284},"community-plans-and-other-plans","Community Plans and Other Plans","/era/deindustrialization/community-plans-and-other-plans",{"id":195,"name":196,"link":202,"view":195,"chapters":286},{}],"uses":{}}]}
