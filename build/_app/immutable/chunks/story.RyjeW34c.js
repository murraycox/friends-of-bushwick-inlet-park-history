Clay Street south to Java Street was mostly given over to lumber yards, bringing bulk wood products in via the waterfront for distribution throughout the city. These yards continued in operation through the late 20th century and much of the property is now developed as Greenpoint Landing. South of Greenpoint Avenue was the American Manufacturing Company (better known now as Greenpoint Terminal Market), another rope and ship’s stores manufacturing company. And south of there was the Continental Iron Works, still in operation in 1900. South of the inlet in Williamsburg, Standard Oil and the Williamsburg Gas Light Company continued to operate as described above. Cooperages (barrel factories – barrels were the preferred containers for bulk sugar and other products), distilleries, coal pockets (coal transfer stations) and sugar refineries occupied the waterfront south of North 4th Street.
