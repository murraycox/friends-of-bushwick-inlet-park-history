The park was created in 2005, a giveback from the City of New York to the residents of North Brooklyn as part of a massive waterfront rezoning that so far has added more than 50,000 new residents to these neighborhoods. The design of the park is guided by a master plan design prepared by Donna Walcavage of Stantec and endorsed through a community process in 2007.</p><h2><b>Bushwick Inlet Park</b></h2><p>When it is completed, <b>Bushwick Inlet Park</b> will be the crown jewel set in the midst of 5 miles of almost continuous waterfront esplanades running from the Wallabout Creek to Newtown Creek. Set between Marsha P. Johnson East River State Park to the south and the Greenpoint Monitor Museum to the north, BIP and its immediate neighbors will provide close to 36 acres of contiguous public open space directly on the East River. But almost 20 years after the rezoning, the park is still more of a concept than a reality. As of 2023, less than a third of the park has been constructed, and it was only in the past few years that the City acquired – at great expense – the final piece of the puzzle that makes up Bushwick Inlet Park. Completion of the full park is likely decades away.</p><p>The Bushwick Inlet Park “puzzle” consists of 5 pieces of property, acquired at various times between 2007 and 2016 and scheduled to be developed in phases. </p><figure class="figure">

The history is divided into  five eras, covering pre-European contact through the present day and beyond. To navigate this story, start by clicking on one of the era buttons at the left of the screen (or top of the screen if you are viewing on a handheld device). You can also use the timeline at the bottom of the page, which will expand to show the chapters of each era.</p><figure class="figure">

Historic maps were georeferenced to align with current-day geographies. Georeferencing is particularly tricky when it comes to shorelines, creeks and water features, which shift over time and may not have been as accurately mapped as more terrestrial features were.</p><p>Use the sidebar chapter selector and the timeline below to explore content about Bushwick Inlet through five historical eras. Each era is represented by a circle at the bottom of the screen. Each era has multiple chapters -- select an era and hover over the chapter dots to reveal the story location on the era map. </p><figure class="figure">

The master plan remains the guiding star for the development of Bushwick Inlet Park to this day.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The 2005 rezoning and the Bushwick Inlet Park master plan originally included a 1-acre site at the north side of Bushwick Inlet (to the west of the Motiva site) that is owned by the Greenpoint Monitor Museum. The property was donated to the Museum in 2003 by Motiva Enterprises, a joint venture of Shell Oil and Saudi Aramco, which had acquired the property from Texaco. In early plans for Bushwick Inlet Park, the Monitor Museum site is included as part of the park and the property is still mapped as parkland, however the City has since acknowledged that it has no intention of acquiring the Museum parcel through eminent domain.\u003C/p>"}},eras:{"pre-1600s":{id:"pre-1600s",name:"Pre 1600s",shortLabel:"Pre 1620",longLabel:"Before 1620",link:null,view:"pre-1600s",chapters:{"the-creek":{id:"the-creek",name:"The Creek",link:"/era/pre-1600s/the-creek"},"salt-marshes":{id:"salt-marshes",name:"Salt Marshes",link:"/era/pre-1600s/salt-marshes"},"the-waterfront":{id:"the-waterfront",name:"The Waterfront",link:"/era/pre-1600s/the-waterfront"},"indigenous-population":{id:"indigenous-population",name:"Indigenous Population",link:"/era/pre-1600s/indigenous-population"}},type:"era"},"early-european-settlement":{id:"early-european-settlement",name:"Early European Settlement",shortLabel:"1620-1855",longLabel:"Early European Settlement",link:null,view:"early-european-settlement",chapters:{"bushwick-patent":{id:"bushwick-patent",name:"Bushwick Patent",link:"/era/early-european-settlement/bushwick-patent"},"bushwick-village":{id:"bushwick-village",name:"Bushwick Village",link:"/era/early-european-settlement/bushwick-village"},"the-founding-of-williamsburgh":{id:"the-founding-of-williamsburgh",name:"The Founding of Williamsburgh",link:"/era/early-european-settlement/the-founding-of-williamsburgh"},"greenpoint-urbanizes":{id:"greenpoint-urbanizes",name:"Greenpoint Urbanizes",link:"/era/early-european-settlement/greenpoint-urbanizes"},"early-industrialization":{id:"early-industrialization",name:"Early Industrialization",link:"/era/early-european-settlement/early-industrialization"},"williamsburg-becomes-a-city":{id:"williamsburg-becomes-a-city",name:"Williamsburgh Becomes a City",link:"/era/early-european-settlement/williamsburg-becomes-a-city"},"ecological-impact":{id:"ecological-impact",name:"Ecological Impact",link:"/era/early-european-settlement/ecological-impact"}},type:"era"},"urban-industrial":{id:"urban-industrial",name:"Urban + Industrial Era",shortLabel:"1850-1950",longLabel:"Urban and Industrial Era",link:null,view:"urban-industrial",chapters:{"williamsburg-industrialize":{id:"williamsburg-industrialize",name:"Williamsburg Industrialize",link:"/era/urban-industrial/williamsburg-industrializes"},demographics:{id:"demographics",name:"Demographics",link:"/era/urban-industrial/demographics"},"the-creek-disappears":{id:"the-creek-disappears",name:"The Creek Disappears",link:"/era/urban-industrial/the-creek-disappears"},"eastern-district-terminal":{id:"eastern-district-terminal",name:"Eastern District Terminal",link:"/era/urban-industrial/eastern-district-terminal"},"williamsburg-bridge":{id:"williamsburg-bridge",name:"Williamsburg Bridge",link:"/era/urban-industrial/williamsburg-bridge"}},type:"era"},deindustrialization:{id:"deindustrialization",name:"Deindustrialization",link:null,view:"deindustrialization",chapters:{"williamsburg-deindustrializes":{id:"williamsburg-deindustrializes",name:"Williamsburg Deindustrializes",link:"/era/deindustrialization/williamsburg-deindustrializes"},"community-plans-and-other-plans":{id:"community-plans-and-other-plans",name:"Community Plans and Other Plans",link:"/era/deindustrialization/community-plans-and-other-plans"}},type:"era"},"the-future":{id:"the-future",name:"The Future",link:null,view:"the-future",chapters:{},type:"era"}}}},uses:{}}],
